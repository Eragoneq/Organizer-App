# Organizer app

This small app is supposed to organize a bit of my student work. Main purpose is to just create a todo list, but also create an environment for easy shortcuts to scripts and apps that I use.

The app right now uses Electron (maybe adds a bit too much bloat for this project), but this might change in the future. Right now the development speed and usability are the most important factors.
